## PROJECT CASE

Can A.I. accurately predict red wine quality rating? <br>
Anyway, what is quality if not how wine taster's tongue precepts wine's chemical components?<br>  

Let's try to answer that question with machine learning approach, where various classifier algorithms will try to
discover all the patters in wine rating process. As a last part of a project, let's build some artificial sommeliers 
and let them handle real-world wine samples. Everything in a form of python flask application.



## APP STRUCTURE

Flask App has 4 views, each of them representing different stage of machine learning process. Each section ends with downloadable code template.

### Part 1 - Dataset Overview

First, we'll have a closer look on dataset. With numpy, pandas, seaborn and scikit-learn:

<br>
### Part 2 - Building Classifier 

In the next step we'll build foundations of our classifier while choosing best fitting algorithms:

<br>

### Part 3 - Fitting Classifier

Now, it's a time to test our classifiers and see how they're performing:
